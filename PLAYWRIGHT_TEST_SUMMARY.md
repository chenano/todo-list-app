## ðŸ›  Implementation Details

### Test Setup
- **Framework**: Playwright with TypeScript
- **Test Files**: 
  - `e2e/auth-basic.spec.ts` (30 core tests)
  - `e2e/auth.spec.ts` (advanced features)
  - `e2e/dashboard.spec.ts` (protected routes)
- **Configuration**: `playwright.config.ts`
- **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run all basic tests (recommended)
npm run test:e2e:basic

# Run all tests (includes advanced features)
npm run test:e2e

# Interactive UI mode
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Coverage Verification

Each requirement from Task 4.3 has been thoroughly tested:

1. âœ… **Create login page with form integration and error handling**
   - Login form renders and functions correctly
   - Error handling verified through form validation tests
   - Integration with authentication context confirmed

2. âœ… **Create registration page with form integration and success flow**
   - Registration form renders with all required fields
